# Developed a Deep Q-learning based agent for HVAC system optimization

The environment is written using simplistic models based on Heat transfer equations
The agent demonstrates superior performance compared to regular thermostat based control

To run the testing scripts
```python
python testing_real.py
```

This will compare the thermostat based control and Deep Q-learning agent that has been trained in the environment created
